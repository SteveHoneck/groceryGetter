# GroceryGetter

Android application for creating a grocery list (or any shopping list) and organizing the items by store. Built with React Native.

Made specifically for how my wife and I grocery shop. We are in a small town with only a few stores and know what each store carries. So all we need is to know is what to get from each store!
