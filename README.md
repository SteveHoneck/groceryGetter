# GroceryGetter

Android application for creating a grocery list (or any shopping list) and organizing the items by store. Front end built with React Native. User's list is saved via persistent local data storage.

Made specifically for how my wife and I grocery shop. We are in a small town with only a few stores and we know what each store carries. So all we need is to know is what to get from each store!

Future updates:

- Build server and database. Allow multiple users to access the same list.
